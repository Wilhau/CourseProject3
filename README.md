Repository for Course Project for Getting and Cleaning Data on Coursera

This is for the course project of the Getting and Cleaning Data course in the Data Science specialization offered by Johns Hopkins University and Coursera. 

The repo contains the R code (run_analysis.R), the code book and this readme file. The R code reads the training and test data files in their original sub-directories, i.e. "train" and "test". To run the code, please keep the data files in their sub-directories and copy the "train" and "test" sub-directories to your working directory.

The R code produces both the long and wide forms of the required tidy data set. According to TA, either form is OK. The code uses the long form as the base for its calculation. Since it only takes 1 line to change the form from one to the other, both forms are provided.
